        <li class="question">What is a solar energy system?</li>
        <p class="answer">A solar energy system, also known as a solar power system, consists of solar panels (photovoltaic cells) that convert sunlight into electricity, along with other components such as inverters, mounting structures, and wiring.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <li class="question">How do solar panels work?</li>
        <p class="answer">Solar panels generate electricity through the photovoltaic effect, where sunlight is converted into direct current (DC) electricity by semiconductor materials within the solar cells. An inverter then converts this DC electricity into alternating current (AC) electricity for use in homes and businesses.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <li class="question">What are the benefits of installing a solar energy system?</li>
        <p class="answer">Installing a solar energy system can lead to significant cost savings on electricity bills, reduce dependence on fossil fuels, lower carbon emissions, increase property value, and provide energy independence.</p>
      </div>


    <div class="faq-item">
      <li class="question">How much space do I need for solar panels?</li>
      <p class="answer">The space required for solar panels depends on factors such as the size and efficiency of the panels, the amount of sunlight received at your location, and your energy consumption needs. Generally, a typical residential solar panel system requires around 100-400 square feet of roof space per kilowatt of installed capacity.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="faq-item">
      <li class="question">What is the lifespan of solar panels?</li>
      <p class="answer">Most solar panels come with warranties ranging from 20 to 25 years, but they can last much longer with proper maintenance. Solar panels typically degrade at a rate of around 0.5% to 1% per year, meaning they can continue to generate electricity for 30 years or more.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="faq-item">
      <li class="question">Do solar panels work in cloudy or rainy weather?</li>
      <p class="answer">While solar panels are most efficient in direct sunlight, they can still generate electricity on cloudy or rainy days. However, their output will be lower compared to sunny days.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="faq-item">
      <li class="question">Is it possible to store excess energy generated by solar panels?</li>
      <p class="answer">Yes, excess energy generated by solar panels can be stored in batteries for later use. This allows homeowners to use solar energy during times when sunlight is not available, such as at night or during power outages.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="faq-item">
      <li class="question">Are there any government incentives or rebates available for installing solar panels?</li>
      <p class="answer">Many governments offer incentives, rebates, tax credits, and net metering programs to encourage the adoption of solar energy. These incentives vary by location, so it's recommended to check with local authorities or consult a solar installer for details.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <li class="question">How do I maintain my solar energy system?</li>
      <p class="answer">Solar energy systems require minimal maintenance, typically limited to periodic cleaning of the panels and ensuring that trees or other obstructions do not shade the panels. It's also advisable to have a professional inspection of the system every few years to ensure optimal performance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <li class="question">Can I install a solar energy system if I rent my home?</li>
      <p class="answer">While installing a solar energy system on a rented property may be more challenging than on a property you own, some companies offer community solar programs or solar leasing options that allow renters to benefit from solar energy without owning the system themselves. Additionally, you can discuss the possibility of installing a solar energy system with your landlord.</p>
